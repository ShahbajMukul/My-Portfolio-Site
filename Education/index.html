                <p>
                    As an active member of the Developers of Dearborn Club at the University
                    of Michigan-Dearborn, I engage in collaborative game development projects,
                    contributing to both front-end and back-end aspects. In our current
                    school-year long project, we are crafting an immersive story-driven 2D
                    game that plunges players into a world of investigation and mystery. The
                    gameplay intertwines running, combat, and dialogue, offering a rich
                    interactive experience. Players make choices that influence the narrative,
                    leading to multiple endings. This approach ensures a unique journey for each
                    player, as their decisions shape the game's conclusion. Our team is dedicated
                    to delivering engaging gameplay mechanics and a compelling story that keeps
                    players on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating what their choices
                    will bring next.
