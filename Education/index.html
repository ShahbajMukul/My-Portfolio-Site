                <p>As a Computer Hardware Engineer at NASA's L'Space Mission Concept Academy,
                    I collaborate with engineering teams to design and integrate software
                    with hardware systems for space exploration initiatives. My primary focus
                    is the orbiter mission aimed at studying Enceladus, one of Saturn's
                    intriguing moons. I oversee the orbiter's communication and data handling
                    systems, ensuring robust mission control and maintaining the integrity of
                    security protocols. This role allows me to apply my knowledge in a
                    cutting-edge environment, contributing to the advancement of space
                    exploration technology.

                <p>
                    As an active member of the Developers of Dearborn Club at the University
                    of Michigan-Dearborn, I engage in collaborative game development projects,
                    contributing to both front-end and back-end aspects. In our current
                    school-year long project, we are crafting an immersive story-driven 2D
                    game that plunges players into a world of investigation and mystery. The
                    gameplay intertwines running, combat, and dialogue, offering a rich
                    interactive experience. Players make choices that influence the narrative,
                    leading to multiple endings. This approach ensures a unique journey for each
                    player, as their decisions shape the game's conclusion. Our team is dedicated
                    to delivering engaging gameplay mechanics and a compelling story that keeps
                    players on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating what their choices
                    will bring next.
