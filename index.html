      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Shahbaj Mukul, currently navigating through the academic year as
        a Senior at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. I am really pationate about working on projects that are
        impactful
        and have a positive impact on society.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past, I was part of the NASA L'Space Mission Concept Academy, where I worked as a Computer Hardware
        Engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from my course work, I am also a member of the Developers of Dearborn Club at the University of
        Michigan-Dearborn where we build semester/ year long game development projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This past summer, I interned at Plastipak Packaging where I worked on a project that is responsible for tracking
        3 million downtimes per year for plants across the globe. More on this can be found in the Experience section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're here for a quick flyby or to get to know me better, I'm delighted to
        have you on board. Enjoy the journey!
