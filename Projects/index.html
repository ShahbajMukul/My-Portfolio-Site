                        <h3>Atomio - A STEM Focused Social Media Platform</h3>
                        <p>
                            Atomio is a full-stack web application that I developed using the MERN stack and later added
                            the
                            support for android devices using Android Studio. It is a social media
                            platform that is focused on STEM. It allows users to create posts, like posts, comment on
                            posts,
                            and follow other users. This
                            project was a great learning experience for me as I learned how to work with the MERN stack
                            and
                            how to create a full-stack application. It has an authentication system that allows users to
                            securely log in and log out of the application. The android application is highly responsive
                            and
                            has a user-friendly interface. The support for IOS devices is in the works. The software
                            also
                            has a
                            content moderation system powered by an AI that checks the content of the user's posts
                            before
                            allowing them to post to keep
                            the community safe.

                        <p>
                            I built this advanced Windows Forms application
                            designed to simplify the process of managing college courses. Developed in C#,
                            this system interfaces seamlessly with SQL Server to offer robust and efficient
                            data management capabilities. It boasts a user-friendly interface that allows for
                            the easy addition, modification, and deletion of courses, instructors, sections,
                            students, and grades. This project was a deep dive into the world of database
                            management,
                            enhancing my proficiency in SQL and back-end development.

                            The Dark Hall is a 3D psychological horror game that my team and I developed using Unity and
                            C#. It is a first-person game where the player wakes up in a dark hall and has to find a way
                            out. The game is filled with jump scares that will keep the player on the edge of their
                            seat. This game was a great learning experience for me as I learned how to work with 3D
                            models and animations in Unity.

                        <p>
                            The Bounce Ball Remastered is a reimagined
                            classic that was brought to life through a blend of creativity,
                            collaboration, and technical skill. Developed using Unity and C#, we
                            focused on creating immersive levels with intricate designs that
                            challenge players' strategic thinking. Overcoming obstacles like
                            spikes, rolling blades, or trees with sharp edges, our team worked in tandem
                            to ensure a seamless gaming experience. This project not only tested
                            our technical abilities but also strengthened our project management
                            and teamwork skills.

                    <h3>Space Invaders</h3>
                    <p>
                        Space Invaders is our team's homage to the arcade classic, developed using
                        UWP using C# and XAML. This project was an exercise in nostalgia, infused
                        with modern development practices. We focused on creating engaging gameplay,
                        smooth user controls, and a scoring system that offers both challenge and
                        reward. Each stage of development, from the sprite animations to the
                        collision detection logic, was a step in our journey of learning and
                        collaboration.

                        <h3>Instagram Astronomy Bot</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project is an automation tool that I developed using Python where I leveraged
                            Instagram,
                            Google, and NASA's APIs to post daily astronomy facts and images on an Instagram page. The
                            bot
                            is designed to run daily and post a new fact and image every day. This project was a great
                            learning experience for me as I learned how to work with APIs and how to automate tasks
                            using
                            Python. The bot has been running successfully for over a year now providing daily doses of
                            cosmos to its followers.
