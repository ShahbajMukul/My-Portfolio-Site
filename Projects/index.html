                        designed to simplify the process of managing college courses. Developed in C#,
                        this system interfaces seamlessly with SQL Server to offer robust and efficient
                        data management capabilities. It boasts a user-friendly interface that allows for
                        the easy addition, modification, and deletion of courses, instructors, sections,
                        students, and grades. This project was a deep dive into the world of database management,

                        classic that was brought to life through a blend of creativity,
                        collaboration, and technical skill. Developed using Unity and C#, we
                        focused on creating immersive levels with intricate designs that
                        challenge players' strategic thinking. Overcoming obstacles like
                        spikes, rolling blades, or trees with sharp edges, our team worked in tandem
                        to ensure a seamless gaming experience. This project not only tested
                        our technical abilities but also strengthened our project management
                        and teamwork skills.

                        Space Invaders is our team's homage to the arcade classic, developed using
                        UWP using C# and XAML. This project was an exercise in nostalgia, infused
                        with modern development practices. We focused on creating engaging gameplay,
                        smooth user controls, and a scoring system that offers both challenge and
                        reward. Each stage of development, from the sprite animations to the
                        collision detection logic, was a step in our journey of learning and
                        collaboration.
